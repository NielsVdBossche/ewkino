## combine primary datasets

Note: this functionality has been outdated and replaced by equivalent scripts in the skimmer directory.
The combinePD script is still compatible with the rest of the framework and compiles without errors.
However, it will not work out of the box, as it uses qsub submission instead of condor.
Kept here for reference only, please use the more recent skimmer functionality.
